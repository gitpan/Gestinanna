This is the Gestinanna Application Framework for Apache/mod_perl.  This 
is a highly intensive XML environment from the scripting to the final 
output to the client.

See the examples in examples/ to see details.

THIS IS ALPHA CODE.  Do not expect it to work without a little effort.  
We are working on documentation.  There are bugs.  Etc.  Feel free to 
contact the author or post questions to the mod_perl list or other 
venues as appropriate.  There is a mailing list on sourceforge for 
this project as well.

This package is an early release to get the code out for comment.

For installation information, see INSTALL.
