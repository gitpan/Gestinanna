                           ---------------

This is the Gestinanna Application Framework for Apache/mod_perl.  This 
is a highly intensive XML environment from the scripting to the final 
output to the client.  

Instead of being yet another content management system, Gestinanna is 
a process management system.  Except for the model portion of the MVC 
design pattern, every part of an application is a document.  This 
includes both the controller and the views.

The controllers are written in an XML language that allows for 
descriptive programming instead of imperative programming: describe 
the structure of the application and what happens when a customer goes 
from one view to another.  This description is then compiled into Perl 
for actual execution on the server.  Controllers may inherit other 
controllers in both IS-A and HAS-A relationships.  Inheritance applies 
to states, transitions, and views, allowing for extensive code reuse 
when building new applications.

The system comes with support for taglibs, controllers, views, 
documents, portal-like pages, and workflows.

THIS IS ALPHA CODE.  Do not expect it to work without a little effort.  
We are working on documentation.  There are bugs.  Etc.  Feel free to 
contact the author or post questions to the mod_perl list or other 
venues as appropriate.  There is a mailing list on sourceforge for 
this project as well.

This package is an early release to get the code out for comment.

For installation information, see INSTALL.
