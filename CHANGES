 o Basic workflow support.  See the listserv package for an example.

 o Added a package system.  Shell support is not complete, but 
   sufficient for installing a package.

 o Moved sample pages into packages installable via the package system.

 o Added site configuration single inheritance.

 o Extensive unit tests in the low-level modules.  Not yet complete.

 o Split state machine XML schema into two namespaces: state machine 
   and scripting.

 o Added untested code for future support of workflows.

 o shell tool may be configured not to use a pager.

 o Added `site clone' command to the shell.  Both cloning and creating 
   a site will now create a site configuration as well.

 o Added `site config' command to the shell to edit an existing site's 
   configuration.  The resulting configuration must be parsable by 
   XML::LibXML.

 o The `site uri add' command now takes an argument to indicate the 
   object type the URI refers to.

 o Gestinanna::Request::get_url added to resolve an object to a url 
   (for use by Apache::AxKit::Provider::Gestinanna).

 o Alzabo naming routine updated for Alzabo 0.82.

 o Namespace handlers for XSM scripts are now configurable on a per-
   site basis.

 o Namespaces can be specified for namespace handlers, overriding the 
   default.  This is useful for using different handlers that offer 
   the same interface but work with different backends.

 o Configuration information specific to a content handler type is now 
   enclosed in a <config/> tag.
